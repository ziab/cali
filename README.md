This is a project that I came up with while refreshing my knowledge of linear algebra and learning DirectX

There are two major references: 
* Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Applications - a great book for learning linear algebra https://github.com/jvanverth/essentialmath
* Precomputed Atmospheric Scattering Papaer - a method for rendering atmospheric effects in real time (I had to port it form OpenGL to DirectX) https://github.com/ebruneton/precomputed_atmospheric_scattering
